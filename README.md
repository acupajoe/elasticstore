# Elasticsearch + CloudFirestore = Elasticstore

A pluggable integration with ElasticSearch to provide advanced content searches in Firestore.

This script can:

- monitor multiple firestore `collections` and `subcollections` and add/modify/remove indexed elasticsearch data in real time
- `transform`, `filter`, `include`, `exclude` and `mapping` functionality for each document 
- communicates with client completely via Firebase (no elasticsearch client required, though a query builder is recommended)
- clean up outdated requests

Heavily Inspired by the Realtime Database implementation (Flashlight) by the [Firebase Team](https://github.com/firebase/flashlight)


## Getting Started:

- Install and run [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) either locally or with a service
- `git clone https://github.com/acupajoe/elasticstore`
- `npm install`
- Supply `.env` with variables OR define them in your environment (see supplied `.env.sample`)
- Edit `src/references.ts` to include your configuration (see below)
- `npm run start`

So for instance, maybe I want to index a collection called `groups` that does a `tranform`ation on the data received from firestore, and maps a firestore `geopoint` to an elasticsearch `geo_point`
```
// firestore (in the console)
groups: {
  12341235: {
    title: "Group Name",                  // string
    description: "I'm a group",           // string
    location: "32,-74"                    // geo_point
    createdAt: "9/4/2018 00:00:00 GMT-0"  // date
  }
}

// references (in ./src/references.ts)
{
  ....
  {
    collection: "groups",
    index: "groups",
    type: "groups",
    mappings: {
      location: {
        type: "geo_point" // elasticsearch's definition of a geopoint
      }
    },
    transform: (data, parent) => ({
      ...data,
      location: `${doc.location._latitude},${doc.location._longitude}` // transform from firestore's geopoint to elasticsearch's
    })
  },
  ....
}
```

# Restrictions / Caveats

Be aware that on large `collection`s, this will need some tuning. Upon starting (and restarting) *ALL* data is re-indexed unless you choose to filter it yourself. This is a *VERY* expensive operation, as you will have to perform reads on every document you have in your `collection`.

When dealing with subcollections, a listener is added for each `collection` which then adds a listener to the specified `subcollection`. If you don't filter these, you may end up with a large number of listeners for data that doesn't get changed very often.
